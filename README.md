# VoidRails
This game prototype was made in Unity during a gamejam.

## Description
This is not really a game at this point but quite relaxing to watch. If only screensavers were a thing these days. Rail segments of random length, radius and steepness are generated. They are put together to make a railroad in space of infinte length. The camera sits in a cart, which follows the railroad indefinitely.

## Controls
- No controls
